# About this extension

This extension adds a responsive images element using the fluid_styled_content
system extension.

This is a replacement for the 'image' content element from css_styled_content
and registers itself as 'tt_content.image'. So make sure that css_styled_content
is not active.

## Features

* Allow to force a custom image format
* image formats can be defined using TCA settings (see page.ts)
* renders single images or multiple images (rows or no rows)
